# ChatGPT-Survey

ChatGPT Survey via Python

This Python project utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

It reads data from a CSV file named "chatGPTSurveyGroup.csv" containing survey responses. The python code then generates various types of graphs based on the survey data,
such as vertical bar graphs, horizontal bar graphs, and pie charts, to analyze different aspects of the survey results.

Each graph is generated for various survey questions like age group, gender identity, education path, field of study or profession, ethnicity, experience with ChatGPT,
evaluation of ChatGPT experience, opinions on ChatGPT's use in academia, perceived benefits of ChatGPT in different fields, expected impact of ChatGPT on society,
and concerns about ChatGPT's use in academia.

The project aims to provide visual insights into the survey data regarding participants' demographics, experiences,
and opinions related to ChatGPT and its potential impact on academia and society.
